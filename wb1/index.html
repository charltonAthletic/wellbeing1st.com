    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
        Our aim at Wellbeing 1st is to organise, in todayâ€™s hectic world nourishing, educational retreats for young people suffering with mental health problems or who simply wish to gain greater enjoyment from life.
        <p>The social enterprise company was set up by a recent Cardiff University graduate, who believes in the power of yoga and meditation to allow people to heal themselves and achieve self-actualisation.
        The company was founded in September 2017.

    <h2>Retreat Structure</h2>
    <p>
        There are two retreat offerings at the time of writing: <br><br>
        
        1: A weekend one day retreat that runs from 0930-1530 based in Cardiff. The day will consist of, as a general framework:
       
        <ul>
          <li>A yoga class (mindful movement)</li>
          <li>A presentation on the importance of self-care to cover sleep, food and exercise</li>
          <li>A meditation session</li>
          <li>A wholesome vegetarian lunch</li>
        </ul>
        This program is subject to change depending on the requirements and interests of the group. <br><br>

        2: A three-day residential weekend retreat in a beautiful part of Wales for participants to gain maximum benefit and immerse themselves.

    <h2>Benefits</h2>
    <p>
        The main outcome for the business is to give young people, while on retreat, experience of tools to cope effectively with their mental health issues and to cope with the demands of modern day living. This will reduce the burden on the NHS and avoid an escalation of pre-existing problems. It will empower individuals to lead healthier and happier lives.
